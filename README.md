# RunnerComparison
Compare all kind of task runner, action archestrator, user journey, business workflow, ....

### Runner examples

- DevOps pipelines  .yml
- GitHub actions  .yml
- LogicApps .json
- Durable Functions (async -> queue -> table)
- B2C custom policies .xml

Those are 'task runners' for 'business workflows'. Great!

#### B2C user journey

> How do you think is the runtime of B2C handled under the hood?  
>    
> I've seen a nice presentation how LogicApp Standard does it *under the hood*, like Durable Functions - with all the queue- and table behind the scene for event-sourced-async handling.
>   
> But B2C? Must be a transcoder from Xml to a 'realtime runner' (complete opposite to LogicApps)

... I copied the above paragraph to ChatGPT and the result was mind-blowing and resulted in a powerpoint story line.

## Future

What comes next? 
At the moment of writing ChatGPT arised as the *next big thing*. So here I just want to mention that a "large language model" is great to translate between all the above examples.
